              person standing against a black background. The person is holding a newspaper labeled ‘LATEST NEWS’, which
              is partially on fire at one corner, with blue flames and a faint smoke trail. The fire should be stylized
              and visually striking. The lighting on the person should be moody and cinematic, primarily from the blue
              fire, casting blue highlights and shadows across the face and hands. The subject should wear a black shirt
              and layered silver chains for a bold, modern look. The expression should be serious and contemplative as
              the person looks down at the burning newspaper. The atmosphere should be intense and mysterious.

              sitting inside a car at night, bathed in moody neon lighting. The atmosphere is intense and mysterious,
              with contrasting hues of deep blue and magenta illuminating the interior. Rain droplets streak the car
              window, adding a noir, suspenseful feel. The man grips the steering wheel with a serious expression, his
              face partially shadowed. Replace the driver’s face with the face from the uploaded image, keeping the
              facial features exactly the same. A “Neo-noir” thriller vibe, high contrast lighting, shallow depth of
              field, ultra-realistic, photographed through the car window. Text at the bottom reads “IN THE NIGHT” in
              subtle, elegant font.

              A hyper-realistic close-up portrait of a young man’s face, with only the left half visible and partially
              submerged in water. The scene is illuminated dramatically with soft, ambient blue and pink neon lighting,
